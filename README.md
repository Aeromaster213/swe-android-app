# swe-android-app
An android app developed as part of the SWE course, meant to address SDG-14, Life Under Water

Written in React Native, it shows viewers a map screen with the Google Maps API. When a pin is clicked, it then opens up a video display that holds a (rendered) video and infocard about that pinned location.

Locations come in many varieties:
1. Reclamation sites
2. Plastic disposal sites
3. Oil spill
4. Overfishing
5. Damaged coral reefs
6. Shipwrecks
7. Land reclamation projects
